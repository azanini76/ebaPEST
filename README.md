# Empirical Bayes with ABIC PEST (ebaPEST) inverse model 
November 20th 2018

This folder contains the source code (Beta version), compiled executables and examples to accompany:
Coupling Empirical Bayes and Akaike's Bayesian Information Criterion to Estimate Aquifer Transmissivity Fields by 
Zanini A, D’Oria M, Tanda MG, Woodbury AD. The paper is under review at Mathematical Geosciences

The inverse procedure has been coded as an open source software based on the Bayesian Geostatistical Approach implementation with PEST (bgaPEST, Fienen et al. 2013) package, developed for highly parameterized inversion. The source files are modified versions of the bgaPEST source files written in Fortran.

The manual of the code will be available soon.

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1) ebaPEST_mild.eba or ebaPEST_stron.eba are the instruction files for ebaPEST
2) to run each example, click on run.bat in each of the example folder


DISCLAIMER
There is no warranty about the correctness of ebaPEST or the suitability for any purpose.
