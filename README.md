Coupling Empirical Bayes and Akaike's Bayesian Information Criterion to Estimate Aquifer Transmissivity Fields

Zanini A, Dâ€™Oria M, Tanda MG, Woodbury AD

The paper is under review at Mathematical Geosciences

The folder contatins:
1. the source code (Beta version);
2. an example with a mild heterogeneous transmissivity field;
3. an example with a strong heterogeneous transmissivity field;

The manual of the code will be available soon.
